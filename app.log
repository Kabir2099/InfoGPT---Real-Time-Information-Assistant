Gen AI stands for Generative Artificial Intelligence. It's a type of AI that can create new content, like text, code, images, music, and videos. 

It does this by learning patterns and structures from the vast amounts of data it's trained on.  Think of it like teaching a child to write by showing them lots of books and stories.  The child learns the rules of grammar and language, and eventually, they can write their own creative text. Gen AI works in a similar way, but with much larger datasets and more complex algorithms.
